            <p style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: 500;">
                Welcome to TranspoLink! By accessing our website and using our booking services, you agree to comply with and be bound by the following terms and conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
            <p>
                By using the TranspoLink platform (website, mobile services, and API), you agree to these Terms and Conditions in full. If you do not agree with any part of these terms, please do not use our services.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Booking & Payments</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>All bookings are subject to seat availability and confirmation by the respective transport operators (Bus, Train, Ferry).</li>
                <li>Full payment must be made at the time of booking. We accept major credit cards, online banking, and e-wallets.</li>
                <li>Ticket prices are dynamic and may change based on season, demand, and operator policies without prior notice.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Cancellations & Refunds</h2>
            <p>
                Cancellation policies vary strictly by operator. Generally, tickets are non-refundable once confirmed. However, if a trip is cancelled by the operator due to technical issues or weather, a full refund or rescheduling option will be provided within 14 working days.
            </p>

            <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
            <p>
                You agree not to misuse our platform. This includes fraudulent bookings, using automated scripts to scrape data, or attempting to compromise our security systems. TranspoLink reserves the right to suspend any account found in violation.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>
                TranspoLink acts solely as a ticketing intermediary. We are not liable for delays, accidents, luggage loss, or service failures caused directly by the transport operators. Please refer to the specific operator's terms for liability issues.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Updates to Terms</h2>
            <p>
                We reserve the right to modify these terms at any time. Continued use of the platform after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
            </p>
